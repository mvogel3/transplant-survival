# transplant-survival
For the scope of this project and time constraints, we single organ kidney transplants. Our primary data source was from OPTN.

Blood Type Distribution Statistics: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1112664/blood-type-distribution-us/

Ethnicity of U.S. (as of July 1, 2022): https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI725222
**note that the percentages total 102.5%

Age Groups of U.S. (as of July 1, 2021): https://www.statista.com/statistics/241488/population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age/

There were some categories of data that we eliminated because it lacked information.

Outcomes:
Kidney transplant patient survival tends to be quite good.
With the new continous distribution model of deceased donor kidneys, younger patients on the waitlist could potential receive kidneys sooner, perhaps improving the patient survival rate even further, as they potentially have the most life to live. Time will tell if the continuous distribution model will make this improvement.

Things we would have liked to analyze that may affect survival:
Waitlist time
Status or medical urgency
KDPI
HLA 
More granular data
Type of insurance - health equity issues in public vs private insurance including Medicare which currently includes people you receive Social Security Disability (such as ALS, legally blind) or End-Stage Renal Failure. Treatment approved by Medicare will often result in private insurance automatically making the same treatment approval.
