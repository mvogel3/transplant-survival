# Kidney Transplant Survival Rates: A Look through Time

## Purpose
The purpose of our project was to look at survival rates for kidney transplant patients over time, and compare the rates after 1 year and 20 years to see what insight we might find. To complete this task, we used data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), which is a network that links all professionals involved in the U.S. donation and transplantation system. OPTN was established to address the nationâ€™s critical organ donation shortage and improve the organ matching and placement process. 

## Data Extraction

## Analysis
* The data that we examined went back as far as 1988, and listed the average survival rates of patients and grafts in different age groups. Here you can see the amount of kidney transplants received each year from 1991 to 2021. In 2022, it was reported that the total number of kidney transplants hit a new milestone, with over 25,000 transplants achieved. With so many transplants occurring annually, we wanted to examine what the chances are of survivability by age, and over an extended period of time.

* Here you can see the average survival rates of all patients 1 year after transplantation (on the left) and 20 years after transplantation (on the right). It is interesting to note that the patient survival rates for both 1 and 20 years is higher than the graft survival rates, meaning that some patients will need multiple kidney transplants, should their graft fail to survive. The image on the left shows an average survival rate of 80%, whereas the image on the right shows a survival rate of about 20-25% for grafts 20 years after transplantation, and 45-55% patient survival over 20 years. Since the patient survival rates are an average of all age groups, we will examine on the next slide how those rates are being impacted once age groups are disaggregated.

* In this chart, we examine the average 1 year survival rates for each age group. It should be noted that all age groups have a survival rate of over 78%.The legend shows the colors for each age group, and the graph appears to indicate that patients 49 years and below have the highest rate of survival.

* Lastly, when we examine the survival rates of different age groups 20 years after transplantation, we can see that the rate drops significantly. Again, the younger the patient was at the time of transplantation, the higher their rate of survival. When we think back to the original graph that shows total average survivability of patients over 20 years, we can see the benefit in examining the data by age group instead of as one lump average. Even without taking kidney transplantation into account, the 20 year survival rate of a 65 year old is logically lower than the 20 year survival rate of a child.
