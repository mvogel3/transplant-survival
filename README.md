# Transplant urvival

## Purpose
Right now more than 103,000 people are in need of an organ transplant. So far this year (as of today) there has already been more than 25,000 organ transplants.  The OPTN - Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network oversees the recovery and distribution of solid organs in this country and is operated by UNOS - the United Network for Organ Sharing who manages the system, including policy, matching systems and overseeing local organ procurement organizations. In years past, patients were evaluated primarily on their medical urgency for placement on the organ transplant waitlist. This factor alone does not take into account many other important factors such as age and potential years of post-transplant survival which, along with some other factors, can contribute to a level of inequity in the allocation system, especially to vulnerable populations. 

We looked at survival rates of transplant recipients, especially when grouped by age, to see how this could potentially influence the allocation of the extremely precious and life saving resource of donated organs. For the scope and timeline of this project, we narrowed our focus to include only kidney transplants - as they make up about 60% of all organ transplants in the U.S.

Recently, changes have been made and have very slowly begun to begun to be implemented in how organs are allocated in an attempt to take into account these other factors and make things more equitable. We will look at survival rates of patients.


## Data Source
Our primary data source was from OPTN from July 2023. Much of data used is publicly available from the OPTN web site: http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov
Specifically used were individual reports from 1988 to 2021 on kidney transplant patients by age based on transplant year with separate reports on primary diagnosis, blood type, ethnicity. Survival rates with these factors of 1, 3 and 5 years were also obtained.
An additional report on Survival Rates of all organ transplants by year and age group for 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 year survival rates from 1988 to 2021 was obtained by special request in May 2023.

There were some categories of data that we eliminated because it lacked information, such as HLA, KDPI, the type of kidney received (living vs. deceased donor) and wait times of recipients. Also lacking was de-identified, individual patient information. The most grandular information avaiable was by age group and transplant year.

Ethnicity of U.S. (as of July 1, 2022): https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI725222
**note that the percentages total 102.5%

## Analysis


## Outcomes/Conclusion:
Kidney transplant patient survival tends to be quite good.
With the new continous distribution model of deceased donor kidneys, younger patients on the waitlist could potential receive kidneys sooner, perhaps improving the patient survival rate even further, as they potentially have the most life to live. Time will tell if the continuous distribution model will make this improvement.

Things we would have liked to analyze that may affect survival:
Waitlist time
Status or medical urgency
KDPI
HLA 
More granular data
Type of insurance - health equity issues in public vs private insurance including Medicare which currently includes people you receive Social Security Disability (such as ALS, legally blind) or End-Stage Renal Failure. Treatment approved by Medicare will often result in private insurance automatically making the same treatment approval.
